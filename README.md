smart contract for coffee trades
disclaimer:
Chat gp4 did it i just ask it tho make a solidity smart contract to trade coffee 

imagine the next process:
You go to you local shop and buy some coffee beans single origin, medium roasted or whatever you like, but you want to make sure that the farmer who is the in the bottom of the chain get what he or she  deserves so they can produce more of that great product we all love (or most of us), this is smart contract created to garantee ownership, fair trade, and single origin coffee.
when you pay the money it is split based on percentage example.

20 % retail store
20 % shipping company
10 % coffee roaster
30 % farmer

in this way re-bargain is avoided , as well as, unfair trades that put in danger the sustainability.
